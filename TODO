* Actually implement Ocean (build a Perl generator, then regen the
  bootstrap ocean.pl from Ocean sources).

* Use Gush for wiring together grammars in nondeterministic ways.

* Various parsers that would come in handy:

 - one-pass C with cpp and inline assembly
 - utf-8
 - linker inputs (object files and scripts) to generate platform binaries
